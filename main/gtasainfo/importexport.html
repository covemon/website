 <h1>import / export information</h1>
 <br>
 <p>
 import / export is a non-story mission located in San Fierro. it is required for <a href="#">100% completion</a>.<br><br>
   
 the premise revolves around finding cars and exporting them, then importing them later to drive around. <br><br>
   
 in order to unlock import / export, you must complete 
   <a href="https://covemon.github.io/website/main/gtasainfo/cesar.html">Cesar Vialpando</a>'s mission called 'Customs Fast Track' <br><br>
   
   --- <br><br>
   
   in the beginning, you will only be able to import the 3 cars you moved during the  Customs Fast Track mission. <br><br>
   
   the 3 cars available immediately are the Club, Jester, and Perennial. <br><br>
   
   ---<br><br>
   
   <b><font color="FF0000">### WARNING ###</b></font><br>
with importing, only certain cars are available on certain days. <br>
the cars you are able to import depend on the order you export them. <br>
once the vehicles have been exported, this cannot be changed by normal means ingame. <br>
   <br>
   if this matters to you and you want specific vehicles on specific days, make sure you export vehicles on the respective days. <br><br>
